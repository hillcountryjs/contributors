Help spread word of our events and interact with the community through our social profiles (e.g. twitter). 

Right now we don't have a Facebook page or Google Plus page, but that's not to say we can't. If you're passionate about social media, or just like interacting with people from the industry online, sign up and we'll get you credentials.
