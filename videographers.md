# Videographer

## Goal:
Share our talks with a broader audience.

## Role:
Record presentations during the monthly meetup. This includes those given at the meetup space and those given via Google Hangouts. If possible, live stream the recordings.

Don't worry if you're not sure you can frame the shot right, [our previous "videographer" wasn't all that stellar](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail205.html).

Daniel Chen: Streaming to YouTube and recording.
